We build tools, models, and systems that bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental reality in materials science. Our focus is on developing autonomous platforms that are reproducible, reliable, and equitableâ€”while prioritizing human insight, trust, and interpretability in the AI systems that guide them. We believe true progress lies not in blindly chasing performance, but in understanding why things work and sharing those insights openly. Our lab is a space for pragmatic scientists who value curiosity, clarity, and impact over hype.
